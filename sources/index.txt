Pybv 
=====

This is a Python library I wrote for simulating planar "vehicles" for some research about bootstrapping.
See http://purl.org/censi/2010/boot for details.

There is not much documentation yet, but if you really want, you can find what you want in here.
Otherwise, let me_ know.


See the API_documentation_ generated by epydoc.
